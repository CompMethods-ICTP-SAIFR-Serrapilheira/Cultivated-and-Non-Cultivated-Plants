# 2022 Scientific Computing, QBio Program: Final Project
## 

Welcome! This is a repository that contains exercises of exploratory data analysis from plant diversity in the state of Santa Catarina (SC), Brazil using R. The data used here was obtained with the package "BIEN", and the main goal was to understand if there were differences in diversity between cultivated and non-cultivated native species in SC.

This repository was created as an activity from the Scientific Computing class, that was part of the Serrapilheira/ICTP-SAIFR Training Program in Quantitative Biology and Ecology, in 2022.
